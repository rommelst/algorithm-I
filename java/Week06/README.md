# Hash Tables -- Symbol Table Applications

##### About this week.
>**Hash Tables**: We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash function and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the uniform hashing assumption that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tablesâ€”separate chaining and linear probing. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption.

> **Symbol Table Applications**: We consider various applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.
