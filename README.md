# Algorithms - Part I by Princeton University 
### Taugh by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne.
##### About this course.
>This course covers the essential information that every serious programmer needs to know about algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis of Java implementations. **Part I** covers elementary data structures, sorting, and searching algorithms. **Part II** focuses on graph- and string-processing algorithms. All the features of this course are available for free. It does not offer a certificate upon completion.
